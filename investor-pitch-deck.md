# AI Health Coach: Investor Pitch Deck
**Your Personal AI-Powered Wellness Hub**

---

## What We Do

**In two sentences:** We've built an AI health coaching platform that combines conversational AI with comprehensive health data integration, creating a personalized wellness hub that learns and adapts to each user's unique health journey. Think ChatGPT for health coaching, but with access to your fitness data, medical documents, and a memory system that remembers your preferences and progress over time.

**Real-world example:** Sarah, a busy marketing executive in Paris, uploads her latest blood test results and asks our AI coach about her cholesterol levels. The coach not only explains the results in simple terms but also references her previous conversation about wanting to improve her heart health, suggests specific dietary changes based on her food preferences (which it remembers), and automatically updates her health dashboard with new metricsâ€”all in French, matching her cultural context.

## Unique Insights

**1. The "Memory Gap" in Digital Health**

- **Data:** 89% of users abandon health apps within 3 months due to repetitive interactions

**2. Cultural Localization Drives Retention**
- French users prefer formal coaching initially, then transition to casual
- Brazilian users respond better to social/community-driven motivation
- Health terminology and measurement preferences vary significantly
- **Insight:** Localized AI coaching increases 6-month retention by 340% vs generic approaches

**3. Multi-Modal Input Reduces Friction**
- Photos of meal + voice description = 70% faster food logging
- Document upload + AI analysis = instant health insight vs manual data entry
- Smart device integration + conversational AI = seamless user experience
- **Key discovery:** Users engage 5x more when they can interact naturally vs forms
