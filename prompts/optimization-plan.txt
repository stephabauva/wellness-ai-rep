Mission:
You must analyze the current app and recommend **safe, high-impact optimizations**.  
Focus on **refactoring, network performance, rendering, DB access, or load latency** — but **never at the cost of stability**.

Critical Constraints:
I1 — Feature Isolation:
It is strictly forbidden for any new feature to alter code linked to other features **if it risks modifying or breaking their behavior**, unless you do the following :  
  If alteration is required, you **must**:
  - Assess the **full impact** on all dependent features
  - Anticipate cascade effects
  - Propose a **safe mitigation plans** before proceeding with lean and simple code

I2 — Adaptive Re-evaluation:
If you encounter any obstacle forcing you to change your approach:
- You are FORBIDDEN from "trying something else" blindly
- You MUST pause and re-assess the entire task using the new constraint
- Then propose a new optimal path that still respects I1

I3 - unwanted code:
You are strictly FORBIDDEN to add code that the user did not ask for, you MUST keep the codebase lean, simple and safe.

Optional Cross-Language Refactor Assessment:
You may propose a rewrite or partial replacement of performance-critical code in:
- Go, Rust, Python/FastAPI, Bun, etc.
**Only if:**
- It yields clear performance gains or better maintainability
- It does not destabilize the system
- A clear integration + rollback plan is provided

Replit-specific risks you MUST avoid:
- Breaking WebSocket or HMR during Vite edits
- Over-optimizing HTTP/2 or compression in ways that disrupt socket reuse or hot reload
- Misconfiguring `vite.config.ts` or `server.hmr` (risk: lost connectivity, infinite reloads)
- Disrupting database access or client stability due to persistent sockets
- Replit is fragile — even reverting to previous commits didn’t restore functionality in the past

Do not:
- Introduce new workflows or runtime scripts
- Alter build steps outside Replit's defaults
- Break anything related to `npm run dev`, live preview, or port binding
- Use data samples / mock data, unless it is for small rapid testing

You MUST provide:
1. The identified bottleneck(s)
2. Clear performance goals (e.g. reduce TTFB, request size, bundle size)
3. Optimization options with tradeoffs
4. Recommended approach with explanation
5. Code examples (clean and modular)
6. Rollback/disable mechanism
7. Explicit check: **does this break Vite, HMR, WebSocket, or DB?** If yes — mitigate or reject
8. Ensure that are no unused pieces of code
9. Ensure there are no conflicts between pieces of code.

- Follow typescript best code practice, the plan should require regular 'npm run check' to fix type errors.

The app is in a stable state. Do NOT break it.  
**Stability is sacred. Respect I1 and I2 at all times.**
