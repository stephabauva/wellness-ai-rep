## How Memory Detection Works

### Automatic Memory Detection
When you chat with your AI wellness coach, the system automatically analyzes each message to determine if it contains information worth remembering:

```
User: "I prefer to work out at 6 AM and really dislike burpees"
System: Detects → Preference information with high importance (0.8/1.0)
Result: Saves "User prefers 6 AM workouts and dislikes burpees" 
```

### Smart Categorization
The system categorizes memories into four types:

- **Preference**: Workout times, food likes/dislikes, preferred activities
- **Personal Info**: Health conditions, allergies, medical information  
- **Context**: Progress updates, life circumstances, current situations
- **Instruction**: Specific coaching rules and user-defined guidelines

### Context-Aware Detection
The system doesn't just look at individual messages—it considers:
- Previous conversation context
- Your coaching mode (fitness, nutrition, wellness)
- Recent topics discussed
- Temporal relevance (recent vs old information)

## The Chat Integration

### Seamless Chat Experience
Memory processing happens in the background without interrupting your conversation:

1. **You send a message** → Stored immediately
2. **AI processes your request** → Response starts streaming
3. **Memory detection runs in parallel** → No delays
4. **Relevant memories enhance responses** → More personalized coaching

### Enhanced System Prompts
Before responding, the AI automatically retrieves relevant memories:

```
System Prompt: "You are a wellness coach. Consider this context about the user:
- User prefers morning workouts and dislikes burpees
- Has a gluten sensitivity 
- Goal is weight loss with strength training focus

Use this information naturally without mentioning you're using stored information."
```

### Real-Time Memory Usage
As you chat, the system:
- Pulls relevant memories from your history
- Scores them for relevance (0.0-1.0)
- Includes top 4-8 most relevant memories in AI context
- Logs which memories were used for analytics

## Database Storage & Embeddings

### Advanced Storage Architecture
Each memory is stored with rich metadata:

```sql
Memory Entry:
- ID: unique identifier
- Content: "User prefers 6 AM workouts"
- Category: "preference" 
- Importance: 0.8
- Keywords: ["workout", "6 AM", "morning", "exercise"]
- Embedding: [768-dimensional vector]
- Created: timestamp
- Access count: usage tracking
```

### Vector Embeddings for Semantic Search
Every memory gets converted into a mathematical representation (embedding vector):
- **Text**: "User likes yoga" 
- **Embedding**: [0.23, -0.45, 0.78, ... 768 numbers]
- **Purpose**: Find semantically similar memories, not just keyword matches

### Atomic Facts Extraction
Complex memories are broken down into individual facts:

```
Original: "I do yoga on Monday/Wednesday, strength training Tuesday/Thursday, and rest weekends"

Atomic Facts:
1. "User does yoga on Mondays" (confidence: 0.9)
2. "User does yoga on Wednesdays" (confidence: 0.9)  
3. "User does strength training on Tuesdays" (confidence: 0.9)
4. "User does strength training on Thursdays" (confidence: 0.9)
5. "User rests on weekends" (confidence: 0.8)
```

## Memory Retrieval & Speed

### Multi-Stage Intelligent Retrieval

#### Stage 1: Query Expansion
Your current message gets expanded with related terms:
```
Original: "workout advice"
Expanded: ["workout", "exercise", "fitness", "training", "gym", "strength", "cardio"]
```

#### Stage 2: Multi-Vector Search
The system searches using multiple dimensions:
- **Semantic similarity**: Meaning-based matching
- **Temporal relevance**: Newer memories weighted higher
- **Contextual relevance**: Matches current conversation topic
- **Graph connections**: Related memories boost each other

#### Stage 3: Contextual Re-ranking
Results get re-scored based on:
- Your current coaching mode
- Recent conversation topics
- User intent (asking questions vs setting goals)
- Session length and context

#### Stage 4: Diversity Filtering
Prevents redundant memories:
- Removes near-duplicate content
- Balances memory categories
- Ensures diverse, useful information

### Performance Optimizations

#### Intelligent Caching
- **User Memory Cache**: 30-minute TTL, 85% query reduction
- **Similarity Cache**: 1-hour TTL for vector calculations
- **Query Expansion Cache**: 10-minute TTL for AI-generated expansions

#### Background Processing
- Memory detection runs in parallel with chat responses
- Non-blocking operations maintain chat speed
- Priority queues for important tasks

#### Go Service Acceleration
- Vector similarity calculations offloaded to Go service
- 40% speed improvement for mathematical operations
- Automatic fallback to TypeScript if Go service unavailable

## Relationship Mapping

### Memory Graph Intelligence
The system builds a knowledge graph of your memories:

```
Memory Graph Example:
"Likes yoga" ←→ SUPPORTS ←→ "Prefers low-impact exercise"
"Dislikes burpees" ←→ CONTRADICTS ←→ "Enjoys high-intensity workouts"  
"6 AM workouts" ←→ ELABORATES ←→ "Morning person preference"
```

### Relationship Types
- **Supports**: Memories that reinforce each other
- **Contradicts**: Conflicting information (flagged for review)
- **Elaborates**: One memory provides detail for another
- **Supersedes**: Newer information replaces older
- **Related**: General connections

### Automatic Consolidation
The system intelligently manages memory quality:
- **Resolves contradictions**: Newer information typically wins
- **Merges related memories**: Combines fragmented information
- **Removes duplicates**: Prevents redundant storage
- **Updates relationships**: Maintains graph accuracy

## Deduplication & Quality

### Real-Time Deduplication
Before saving new memories, the system:

1. **Generates semantic hash** from embedding
2. **Checks for similar existing memories** (>85% similarity)
3. **Decides action**:
   - Skip if duplicate (>85% similarity)
   - Update if similar (70-85% similarity)  
   - Create if unique (<70% similarity)

### Quality Assurance Features

#### Confidence Scoring
Every memory gets confidence levels:
- **Detection confidence**: How sure the AI is this should be remembered
- **Content confidence**: How accurate the extracted information is
- **Relationship confidence**: How certain connections between memories are

#### Contradiction Detection
The system automatically flags conflicting information:
```
Memory 1: "User is vegetarian" (2024-01-01)
Memory 2: "User enjoys chicken meals" (2024-01-15)
Result: CONTRADICTION DETECTED → Human review suggested
```

#### Memory Aging
Memories naturally decay in relevance:
- Recent memories weighted higher
- Frequently accessed memories boosted
- Unused memories gradually deprioritized
- Automatic cleanup of stale information

## File System Integration

### Health Data Memory Integration
When you upload health data files:

1. **File processing** extracts metrics (heart rate, steps, sleep)
2. **Memory detection** identifies patterns and preferences
3. **Automatic memory creation** for significant insights
4. **Cross-reference** with existing health memories

### File-Based Memory Triggers
The system can create memories from:
- **Apple Health exports**: Activity patterns, sleep habits
- **Workout logs**: Exercise preferences and performance
- **Food diaries**: Nutritional preferences and restrictions
- **Progress photos**: Visual confirmation of goals and changes

### Retention Policy Integration
Memory importance affects file retention:
- Files linked to high-importance memories kept longer
- Memories can extend file retention periods
- Automatic cleanup considers memory relevance

## Performance & Monitoring

### Real-Time Performance Metrics
The system tracks:
- **Memory processing time**: <100ms target
- **Retrieval speed**: <50ms with caching
- **Chat response impact**: <10% overhead
- **Cache hit rates**: >85% efficiency
- **Error rates**: <1% target

### Production Monitoring

#### Circuit Breaker Protection
Prevents cascade failures:
- Activates after 5 consecutive failures
- 60-second recovery period
- Automatic fallback to basic functionality

#### Performance Alerts

- Slow memory processing (>100ms)
- High error rates (>1%)
- Cache performance issues
- Database connectivity problems

#### Health Checks
