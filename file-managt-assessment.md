## Current Status
- âœ… Phase 1: File categories system implemented
- âœ… Phase 2: CategorySelector component created
- âœ… Phase 3: FileUploadDialog integration completed
- âœ… **Database Migration: COMPLETED** (Tables created successfully)
- ðŸ”„ **Category Seeding: EXECUTING** (Running TypeScript seeding script)

## Issue Resolution
The original script failed because:
- Used ES6 `import` syntax in a `.js` file without proper module configuration
- Node.js expected CommonJS syntax by default

**Solution:** Created TypeScript version using `tsx` runner (already available in project)

## Next Steps Required
1. âœ… Run the category seeding script with `npx tsx seed-categories.ts`
2. Test file upload with category selection
3. Verify categories appear in the CategorySelector dropdown
