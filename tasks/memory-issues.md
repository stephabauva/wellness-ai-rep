1- [ ] there are too many words surrounding a memory, for example for the memory ‘User starts their workout with chin-ups and dips.’ above it it says “preferences’ and ‘medium’. Then below the memory is says “workout” and “general” and then agin below that is says “chins-up, dips, workout preferences”, it’s redundant and too much, needs to be cleaner and leaner.

2- [ ]i see memories that are similar, memory deduplication must work when a memory is coming from the chat and when added from the memory page directly. 

3- [ ] i think the memory page overview and the tabs together is redundant since the overview shows the same tab names. just make each item of the memory overview clickable, to replace the tabs. 
4- [ ] the memory overview count does not update immediatly when a memory is added or deleted.
