implementing a GPT-like context memory system with persistence for images, texts, and documents is both fascinating and complex. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step. You‚Äôll essentially be recreating a context window with managed state, and optionally a long-term memory system if you want persistence across sessions.

‚∏ª

üß© Part 1: Core Concepts

Before implementation, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need to recreate:

Feature	Description
Context window	A temporary buffer of all interactions during a session, capped by your model‚Äôs max token limit.
Image processing	Convert images to useful internal representations (e.g. embeddings, captions, object tags, OCR).
Unified prompt	Combine the user history, image interpretations, and documents into a single prompt for the model.
Persistence	Optional long-term memory ‚Äî storing useful state across sessions (e.g., user goals, past image metadata).


‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Part 2: Stack Overview

Here‚Äôs a suggested tech stack:

Component	Tools / Libraries
Backend	Node.js, Python (FastAPI or Flask)
LLM	OpenAI GPT-4o or Claude (for multimodal)
Image Processing	OpenAI Vision API, CLIP, BLIP-2, or Gemini Vision
Embedding	OpenAI Embeddings, Hugging Face models
Vector DB (optional)	Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or PostgreSQL pgvector
Storage	S3/GCS for raw files; JSON/DB for session logs
Frontend (if needed)	React + Tailwind (or any frontend stack)

üõ†Ô∏è Part 3: Implementation Steps

1. Session Context Manager (Short-term memory)

Create a rolling context window (like a chat log):
  ‚Ä¢	Keep all user + assistant messages
  ‚Ä¢	Truncate when total token size exceeds LLM limit (e.g. 128k tokens)
  ‚Ä¢	Use token counter (e.g. tiktoken for OpenAI)

class SessionContext:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=120000):
        self.messages = []
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens

    def add(self, role, content):
        self.messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
        self._truncate()

    def _truncate(self):
        # remove oldest messages if token limit exceeded
        # you'll need a tokenizer here to measure tokens
        pass

    def get_prompt(self):
        return self.messages


‚∏ª

2. Image Upload & Processing Pipeline

When a user uploads an image:
  1.	Store the raw image (e.g. in /uploads)
  2.	Process the image:
  ‚Ä¢	Captioning: Use BLIP, Gemini Vision, or GPT-4o Vision
  ‚Ä¢	Object detection: YOLO or similar (optional)
  ‚Ä¢	OCR: Tesseract or GPT-Vision
  ‚Ä¢	Embeddings: Optional, for similarity search

Save the results:

{
  "image_id": "abc123",
  "caption": "A grilled salmon fillet served with asparagus and cherry tomatoes.",
  "objects": ["salmon", "asparagus", "tomato", "lemon"],
  "uploaded_at": "2025-06-07T18:52:00Z"
}

This processed description is what you feed into the context window ‚Äî not the image itself.

‚∏ª

3. Add Processed Output to Context

After processing the image, add a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù message:

{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "User uploaded an image: A grilled salmon fillet served with asparagus and cherry tomatoes. It also includes lemon slices and fresh dill."
}

This is what the LLM ‚Äúremembers‚Äù.

‚∏ª

4. Document Handling

Same as images:
  ‚Ä¢	Parse text (use pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or similar)
  ‚Ä¢	Break into sections if large
  ‚Ä¢	Add useful sections into the context or index them separately for retrieval

‚∏ª

5. Optional: Long-Term Memory Layer

To make your system persistent across sessions:
  ‚Ä¢	Store summaries, processed image metadata, and user preferences in a database
  ‚Ä¢	Use semantic search (via embeddings) to retrieve relevant past content
  ‚Ä¢	On session start, inject past memory into context if relevant

Example:

def load_user_memory(user_id):
    # Load facts like "User prefers salmon recipes" or "Uploaded images about fitness"
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": "User prefers healthy meals like grilled salmon and vegetables."}
    ]


‚∏ª

6. Prompt Building (Unifying All Content)

Final input to the model is:

prompt = session_context.get_prompt() + load_user_memory(user_id)
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=prompt)


‚∏ª

üß† Bonus: Visual Memory Graph (Advanced)

If you want to build a visual memory dashboard, you can show:
  ‚Ä¢	Uploaded images
  ‚Ä¢	Captions
  ‚Ä¢	Timestamps
  ‚Ä¢	Related queries
  ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúUsed in‚Äù conversation IDs

‚∏ª

üß™ Testing & Scaling Tips
  ‚Ä¢	Use tools like Langfuse or Helicone to debug prompts and costs.
  ‚Ä¢	Limit token bloat with summarization of old messages.
  ‚Ä¢	Use streaming for smoother UX on chat frontend.
