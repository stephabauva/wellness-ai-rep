# Todo: Prevent Feature Breakage Strategy

## Scope
- Implement safeguards to prevent new features/bug fixes from breaking existing functionality
- Focus on core wellness AI app features: voice/text chat, memory system, health tracking
- Ensure French market readiness doesn't break English functionality

## Context
Core app purpose: Personal wellness AI coach with:
- Voice/text/attachment conversations
- Persistent memory about user
- Health data integration (with user consent)
- Smart device connectivity (scales, watches)
- Complete user data control
- Multi-language support (English now, French planned)

## Risk Assessment
- **Critical Dependencies**: Chat ↔ Memory ↔ Health ↔ Settings
- **High-risk areas**: 
  - Memory retrieval during chat (performance + accuracy)
  - Health data consent flow (privacy critical)
  - Voice transcription (browser API fragility)
  - File attachments (cross-domain usage)
- **Potential conflicts**: 
  - Language switching affecting all UI components
  - Memory system changes breaking chat context
  - Health data structure changes breaking dashboard

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Immediate Protection (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Create smoke test suite for 5 critical paths
   - Voice message → Transcription → Send → Memory creation
   - File upload → Attach to chat → AI processing
   - Health data import → Dashboard display → AI access
   - Memory manual creation → Retrieval in chat
   - Settings change → Behavior verification across domains
   
- [ ] Add pre-commit validation script
   - Check for cross-domain import changes
   - Verify no WebSocket/HMR config modifications
   - Ensure CLAUDE.md rules compliance

### Phase 2: Dependency Visualization (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Build dependency analyzer tool
   - Parse imports to create real-time dependency graph
   - Highlight files that touch multiple domains
   - Show impact radius for any file change
   - Flag high-risk modifications (>3 domain touches)

- [ ] Create domain boundary enforcement
   - Define clear interfaces between domains
   - Add TypeScript strict boundaries
   - Prevent direct cross-domain imports

### Phase 3: Feature Isolation (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Implement feature flags system
   - Simple toggle system for new features
   - Gradual rollout capability
   - Quick rollback mechanism
   - Separate flags for English/French features

- [ ] Create integration test harness
   - Test only domain connection points
   - Mock external services (health APIs, AI providers)
   - Verify data flow between domains
   - Check memory performance under load

### Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Add runtime health checks
   - Monitor critical path response times
   - Track memory creation/retrieval success rates
   - Log AI response times by provider
   - Alert on performance degradation

- [ ] Create automated regression detector
   - Run smoke tests on every commit
   - Compare performance baselines
   - Flag unusual error patterns
   - Check for missing translations

## Safety Checks
- [ ] All tests pass before any deployment
- [ ] No direct domain coupling introduced
- [ ] Performance baselines maintained
- [ ] French translations don't break English
- [ ] Voice/health APIs remain stable
- [ ] Memory retrieval <50ms maintained
- [ ] No unused code or features added

## Implementation Priority
1. **Smoke tests first** - Immediate protection (30 min)
2. **Dependency analyzer** - See impact before changes
3. **Feature flags** - Safe new feature deployment
4. **Integration tests** - Catch cross-domain breaks

## Success Metrics
- Zero production breaks from new features
- <5 min to identify breaking changes
- All critical paths tested automatically
- Clear visibility of change impact
- Confidence to add French support safely

## Notes
- Focus on protecting core wellness journey: Talk → Remember → Track → Improve
- Prioritize user trust through stability
- Keep tests simple and fast (full suite <2 min)
- Document any new domain boundaries created
