Excellent question. This is a classic state management and data flow issue in React applications. Based on the `ChatSection.tsx` code you've provided, here is the most likely reason for the behavior you're describing.

### The Core of the Problem

The problem is almost certainly **not in the `ChatSection.tsx` component you've provided**, but rather in the custom hook it consumes: **`useChatMessages`**.

Let's break down why.

1.  **How `ChatSection.tsx` Displays Messages:**
    Your `ChatSection` component has a piece of logic that decides what messages to render:

    ```javascript
    // Safe message display logic
    let messagesToDisplay = [];
    
    try {
      if (currentConversationId && Array.isArray(messages)) {
        // Active conversation - show all messages
        messagesToDisplay = [...messages]; 
        // ...
      } else {
        // New conversation - show welcome message
        messagesToDisplay = [welcomeMessage];
        // ...
      }
    } 
    // ...
    ```

    This logic is sound. It says: "If there's an active conversation, display everything in the `messages` array that I get from the `useChatMessages` hook."

2.  **The Symptom and the Deduction:**
    *   **Symptom:** Only the first user message and the AI response show. Subsequent messages seem to replace the old ones in the view.
    *   **Deduction:** This means that the `messages` array being passed from `useChatMessages` to `ChatSection` is not the *complete history* of the current conversation. Instead, it likely only contains the *most recent exchange* (the last user message and its corresponding AI reply).

### The Likely Bug in `useChatMessages`

Inside your `useChatMessages` hook, you are using a mutation (`sendMessageMutation`) to send a message. When that mutation is successful, the backend likely returns the new user message and the new AI response. The bug is in how you are updating your local state with this new data.

**Incorrect Logic (What is likely happening now):**

Your hook's state update logic probably looks something like this. This is a common mistake.

```javascript
// Inside useChatMessages.ts (Hypothetical bad code)

const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

const sendMessageMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: api.sendMessage,
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    // data contains just the new messages, e.g., [userMsg, aiReply]
    
    // ❌ BUG: This REPLACES the entire messages array
    // with ONLY the new ones.
    setMessages(data.newMessages); 
  }
});
```

**Correct Logic (How to fix it):**

You need to append the new messages to the *existing* `messages` array instead of replacing it. The fix is to use a functional update with `setMessages`.

```javascript
// Inside useChatMessages.ts (Hypothetical good code)

const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

const sendMessageMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: api.sendMessage,
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    // data contains just the new messages, e.g., [userMsg, aiReply]

    // ✅ FIX: Use a functional update to APPEND the new messages
    // to the previous state.
    setMessages(prevMessages => [...prevMessages, ...data.newMessages]);
  }
});
```

If you are using `react-query`, the same principle applies when you update the query cache in the `onSuccess` callback. You must ensure you are adding to the existing data, not overwriting it.

### Why does the Conversation History panel still work?

This is the key clue that confirms our theory.

The `ConversationHistory` component (`<ConversationHistory />`) is separate. When it opens, it likely triggers its own data fetch to get a list of all past conversations. When you click a conversation, your `handleSelectConversation` function probably fetches the **entire message history for that specific conversation ID** from the database and sets the `messages` state with that complete list.

-   **Chat View:** Relies on a local, live `messages` state that is being updated *incorrectly* (overwritten) after each new message.
-   **History View:** Relies on a fresh, full data fetch from the server, which always retrieves the complete and correct history from the database.

### Summary

1.  **The Problem:** Your `useChatMessages` hook is overwriting the `messages` state with only the newest message exchange, instead of appending to the list.
2.  **The Location:** The bug is inside the `onSuccess` handler (or equivalent logic) of your `sendMessageMutation` within the `useChatMessages.ts` file.
3.  **The Fix:** Change the state update from `setMessages(newData)` to `setMessages(prev => [...prev, ...newData])` to correctly append messages.
4.  **Why History Works:** The history panel performs a separate, full fetch of the conversation from the database, bypassing the buggy "live" state of the chat window.
