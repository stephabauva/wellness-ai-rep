# Database Indexing Investigation Plan

## Overview
Investigation into why the database health check reports "0 indexes" despite successful index creation, and implementation of proper "public tables" logging for clarity.

## Current Issue Analysis

### Problem Statement
- **Index Creation**: 26 indexes created/verified successfully (0 failed)
- **Health Check**: Reports "0 indexes" immediately after
- **Table Reporting**: Shows "7 tables" but unclear if these are public tables
- **User Confusion**: Discrepancy between creation success and health check results

### Root Cause Hypotheses
1. **Timing Issue**: Health check runs before PostgreSQL system catalogs update
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Indexes created in different schema than queried
3. **Query Logic Error**: Index counting query has filtering issues
4. **Connection Context**: Different connections between creation and health check

## Investigation Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics
- Implement detailed database schema inspection
- Add "public tables" terminology to console logs
- Create comprehensive index verification system
- Add timing analysis between creation and verification

### Phase 2: Health Check Query Optimization
- Fix index counting query logic
- Add fallback verification methods
- Implement schema-aware table/index counting
- Add performance timing metrics

### Phase 3: Production Reliability
- Add retry mechanisms for health checks
- Implement connection pooling awareness
- Create database state consistency checks
- Add monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Strong typing for all database operations
