The core problem lies in the go-ai-gateway. Even though the client-side useStreamingChat is set up to handle chunk events, and the AI providers (like OpenAI) support streaming, the go-ai-gateway is not forwarding these chunks as they arrive. Instead, it's waiting for the entire AI response to be received, then sending it as a single, large chunk to the client. This explains why the client receives "big batches of text" rather than a continuous stream.

To fix this, the makeHTTPRequest functions in both OpenAIHandler and GoogleHandler need to be modified to:

Detect if the request is a streaming request (i.e., req.Stream is true).
If it's a streaming request, instead of io.ReadAll, they should read the response body incrementally and forward each received chunk to the client as an SSE data: event. This will involve setting the Content-Type header to text/event-stream and flushing the response writer after each chunk.
This will require significant changes to the makeHTTPRequest methods and potentially the chatHandler to handle the SSE connection properly.

I will now outline the plan to implement this.

Plan:

Modify chatHandler in main.go:

Change the chatHandler to handle streaming requests differently. If req.Stream is true, it should set up an SSE response and call a new streaming-specific processing function.
Remove the caching for streaming requests, as streaming responses are not typically cached in their entirety.
Create a new streaming function in providers.go (e.g., StreamRequest):

This function will be called by chatHandler for streaming requests.
It will take http.ResponseWriter and *http.Request (or *gin.Context) as arguments to directly write SSE events.
Inside this function, it will make the actual HTTP request to the AI provider.
It will then read the response body from the AI provider incrementally (e.g., using a bufio.Scanner or io.Reader with a small buffer).
For each chunk received from the AI provider, it will format it as an SSE data: event and write it to the http.ResponseWriter, followed by a Flush().
Update OpenAIHandler and GoogleHandler:

Add a StreamRequest method to both OpenAIHandler and GoogleHandler interfaces and their implementations.
The StreamRequest method will handle the specific parsing of the AI provider's streaming response format (e.g., OpenAI's data: events or Google's chunk objects) and extract the content.
It will then send these extracted content chunks as data: events to the client.
This is a complex change, as it involves transforming a blocking, full-response API call into a non-blocking, chunk-by-chunk streaming process.

Before proceeding with the implementation, I need to confirm if the user wants to proceed with these changes, as it will involve modifying core server-side logic.
