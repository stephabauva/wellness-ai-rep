# CONTEXT CONTINUATION — Do NOT Forget

You are continuing work on the previous task.

You MUST still follow the critical rules from the initial prompt:

## Stability Rules (MANDATORY)

- Respect I1: DO NOT break or alter any existing feature’s behavior unless explicitly assessed
- Respect I2: If something blocks your current plan, DO NOT guess — re-analyze from scratch
- Respect I3 : Do not write code that user did not ask for. kwwp the codebase lean
- All changes must include safety tests or rollback paths
- Confirm that HMR, WebSocket, Vite dev server, and DB connection remain fully stable

## Replit-Specific Risks (DO NOT BREAK)

- Avoid editing `vite.config.ts`, HMR, WebSocket, compression or persistent connections unless strictly necessary
- NEVER introduce new workflows or bypass Replit tools
- The Replit environment is delicate — even previously working commits didn’t fix broken states
- Never alter DB schema unless asked — use ORM migrations (Drizzle) only

## During This Phase

You must:
1. Generate clean, modular, safe code
2. at the end, update the changelog/<feature>/<feature-name>-implementation-and-fixes.md.

Never skip safety steps. Stability is sacred.
