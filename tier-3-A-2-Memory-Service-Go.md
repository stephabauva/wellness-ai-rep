### 2. Performance-Critical Operations Converted

#### Vector Similarity Calculations
- **Optimized Algorithm**: Fast cosine similarity with pre-computed norms
- **Parallel Processing**: Batch calculations using goroutines for large datasets
- **Cache Integration**: Intelligent similarity result caching with hash-based keys
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to TypeScript implementation

```go
// High-performance similarity calculation
func (ms *MemoryService) fastCosineSimilarity(a, b []float64) float64 {
    var dotProduct, normA, normB float64
    
    // Vectorized operations for better performance
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        dotProduct += a[i] * b[i]
        normA += a[i] * a[i]
        normB += b[i] * b[i]
    }
    
    if normA == 0 || normB == 0 {
        return 0.0
    }
    
    return dotProduct / (math.Sqrt(normA) * math.Sqrt(normB))
}
```

#### Contextual Memory Retrieval
- **Batch Processing**: Simultaneous similarity calculations for all user memories
- **Smart Filtering**: Multi-stage filtering with importance scoring
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory allocation and garbage collection

#### Background Memory Processing

- **Priority Queue**: Task prioritization for optimal resource usage
- **Concurrent Updates**: Safe concurrent memory updates with proper synchronization

### 3. Integration with Node.js Service

#### Hybrid Architecture
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic selection between Go and TypeScript based on operation complexity
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic fallback
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics collection and analysis

```typescript
// Smart service selection
async cosineSimilarity(a: number[], b: number[]): Promise<number> {
    // Use Go service for large vectors and complex operations
    if (goMemoryService.isAvailable() && a.length > 100) {
        try {
            return await goMemoryService.calculateCosineSimilarity(a, b);
        } catch (error) {
            console.warn('[MemoryService] Fallback to TypeScript implementation:', error);
        }
    }
    
    // Fallback to TypeScript implementation
    return this.cosineSimilaritySync(a, b);
}
```

### 4. Advanced Caching System

#### Multi-Level Caching
- **Similarity Cache**: Hash-based caching of vector similarity results
- **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used eviction policy for memory efficiency
