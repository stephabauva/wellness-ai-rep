Two major events have happened that seem to have broken the application : fixes for numerous typescript errors after checking with 'npm run check', and the refactoring in smaller files of server/routes.ts that was almost 4000 lines of code (archive in server/routes.ts.archive).

# Chat :
[ ] user newer conversations not visible in the chat history window or not loadable. Note : i noticed in the console log ' [AiService] Starting ChatGPT memory deduplication processing { userId: 1, conversationId: '', messageLength: 11 }', there is no convesation Id.

[ ] clicking on a past conversation in history results in error "[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Rendered fewer hooks than expected. This may be caused by an accidental early return statement."

[ ] Need to confirm if uploaded file and photo persists in the conversations of the chat history

[ ] console log shows many duplicate logs, for example :
"[MemoryService] getContextualMemories called for user 1, message: "hello coach"
[MemoryService] Context built: "hello coach"
[MemoryService] getContextualMemories called for user 1, message: "hello coach"
[MemoryService] Context built: "hello coach"
/
[DEBUG] [memory] [MemoryService] Contextual memories cache miss for user 1
[DEBUG] [memory] [MemoryService] Contextual memories cache miss for user 1"
/
[MemoryService] Processing background task: similarity_calculation
[MemoryService] Processing background task: similarity_calculation
[MemoryService] Processing background task: similarity_calculation
[MemoryService] Processing background task: similarity_calculation
/

[ ] in console log i see "[WARN ] [memory] Background queue growing large: 14 tasks", this needs to be simplified and optimized

[ ] Transcription of audio to text is not persistant in input field if the user do other audio transcriptions before sending

[ ] Error Handling: What happens if a message fails to send (e.g., network error)? Is there visual feedback?

[ ] File Type/Size Restrictions: No mention of supported file types or maximum file sizes.

[ ] Upload Progress: For larger files, a progress indicator would be beneficial.

[ ] the permission to access the microphone is triggered and displayed as soon as the user enters the chat page, it should triggered only for the first time the user press the mic button or be set by default in the settings.

[ ] missing visual indication in the chat that a message was saved as a memory

[ ] no encryption for messages, attachments, and memories at rest and in transit.(necessary ?)

[ ] No user authentication implemented 

# Health dashboard :
[ ] The user gets a confirmation that metrics were successfully removed, but the metrics are still visible on screen

[ ] the 'add metrics' can be pressed while the 'remove metrics' has already been pressed, you can had and delete metrics at the same time. it should be one at a time, you can't press 'add metrics' if the 'remove metrics' has been pressed, the user must either 'cancel' or delete metrics first. 

[ ] when uploading a health data file, console log shows :
"
Health data file accepted: export.xml.gz (application/gzip)
Large health file detected (28MB), attempting Go service startup...
Starting Go acceleration service automatically...
Go service not responding after startup - continuing with TypeScript processing
File too large for standard decompression, using streaming approach...
Starting streaming decompression for large Apple Health file...
Decompression complete. Total size: 830728002 bytes
DEFAULT SAFETY FILTER: Using 1 month cutoff for memory protection
SMART PARSING: Analyzing 50704 chunks (792MB total) with timestamp-based filtering
TIMESTAMP ANALYSIS: Checking 50704 chunks for data after 2025-06-02T12:04:41.694Z
TIMESTAMP ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Found 875/50704 chunks with relevant data
SMART PROCESSING: Processing 875 relevant chunks (skipping 49829 irrelevant chunks)
SMART PROCESSING COMPLETE: 29460 valid records from 29954 total, 494 skipped by time filter
"
But on screen the user sees '0 valid records', "0 skipped".

[ ] The metrics trend does not update after the user clicks on a dropdown to choose between 'last 7 days', 'last 30 days', 'last90 days'. Needs to check the implementation.

[ ] clicking on 'download pdf' results in error [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Method is not a valid HTTP token. need to verify the full implementation.

[ ] Regardless on the tab selected the weekly activity trend, sleep quality, nutrition, summary, hydration and coaching insights are always displayed

[ ] When uploading a health data file, supported file formats are not specified

[ ] when upload a health data file, the user can choose the 'duplicate detection time window', the user does not need to care about that, this should be a config in the background

[ ] the settings need to be simplified, especially i question the relevance of the Data Export & Portability section.

# Memory page :

[ ] the overview of the number of memories shows total memories, preferences, instruction and personal info, while the tabs show 'all, preferences, personal, context and instructions', this needs to be harmonized

[ ] In the overview, the count for total memories is not displayed

[ ] when the button 'show my stored memories' is pressed, it says ' not stored memories' for 1s and then display the memories, need to fix that.

[ ] there is no search bar to find memories by content or filter by category or source (chat or manual entry)

[ ] The user can't manually edit a memory

[ ] if there are many memories, simply displaying them all at once will lead to performance issues. need to implement pagination in each tab

[ ] the user is not able to export hsi memories, nothing implemented yet

# File manager :

[ ] when uploading a file, the user can't choose a category, there are no visible categories.

[ ] Only the 'All' and 'Uncategorised' are visible

[ ] after checking some files boxes and clicking 'categorise', there are no categories visible.

# Settings :

[ ] overall, the all settings can be stripped  down and simplified

[ ] multi language support (the app can't change its main language, english (current language), french and brazilian-portuguese are the first three languages to  support)

[ ] Account functionalities not implemented (you can't change your photo, can't change password)

[ ] Coach Style & Focus Areas isnot yet integrated into chat context. Coach Communication Style (motivational, educational, supportive, challenging) is not used in chat. Reminder Frequency is not implemented at all

[ ] Dark Mode Functionality - The toggle exists but there's no actual theme switching implementation. No CSS variables, no theme context, no visual changes when toggled.

[ ] Push Notifications Implementation - Toggle exists but no actual push notification service integration

[ ] Email Summaries Backend - Toggle exists but likely no email service implementation

[ ] Data Sharing Logic - Toggle exists but unclear what data sharing actually controls

[ ] The user can enable Go acceleration for file processing, configure caching options, and manage background processing settings : this should be a backend configuration, the user should not care about that
