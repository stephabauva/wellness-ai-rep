**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**

## Overview

Implementation of an intelligent attachment retention system that automatically categorizes and manages uploaded files based on their importance and content type. The system provides customizable retention periods for different categories of health-related documents while ensuring critical medical information is preserved appropriately.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Intelligent File Categorization**
- **Automatic Content Analysis**: Files are categorized based on filename patterns, file types, and contextual analysis
- **Three-Tier Classification System**:
  - **High-Value**: Medical documents, lab results, prescriptions (kept indefinitely by default)
  - **Medium-Value**: Nutrition plans, exercise routines (90 days default)
  - **Low-Value**: Food photos, screenshots, temporary files (30 days default)

### 2. **Smart Retention Policy Engine**
- **Context-Aware Detection**: Analyzes both filename and conversation context to determine file importance
- **Flexible Retention Periods**: Different retention durations based on file category
- **Configurable Defaults**: System-wide default retention periods that can be customized

### 3. **User-Customizable Settings**
- **Settings Integration**: Added retention controls to the main settings interface
- **Granular Control**: Users can customize retention periods for each category:
  - Medical documents: Indefinite, 1 year, 6 months, 3 months
  - Health plans: 6 months, 3 months, 2 months, 1 month  
  - Photos/temporary: 2 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately

### 4. **Automated Cleanup System**
- **Background Processing**: Automatic cleanup of expired attachments
- **Safe Deletion**: Only removes files that have exceeded their retention period
- **Audit Trail**: Logs cleanup activities with file details and reasons
