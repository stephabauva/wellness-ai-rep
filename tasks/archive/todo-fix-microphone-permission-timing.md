# Todo: Fix Microphone Permission Timing

## Scope
- Fix microphone permission being requested on chat page load
- Request permission only when user first clicks microphone button
- No change to overall functionality

## Risk Assessment
- **Dependencies affected**: AudioRecorder component, audio-service
- **Potential conflicts**: None - isolated to permission flow
- **HMR/WebSocket impact**: None - only affects permission timing

## Tasks
- [x] Remove automatic permission check on AudioRecorder mount
- [x] Move permission request to first microphone button click
- [x] Ensure permission state is properly tracked after first request
- [x] Test permission flow with different browser states

## Safety Checks
- [x] HMR/WebSocket stability preserved
- [x] No unused code
- [x] No conflicts with other features
- [x] Production-ready
- [x] Maintains all existing functionality

## Technical Details
Current issue: `useEffect` in AudioRecorder.tsx:36 calls `checkMicrophonePermission()` on mount, which triggers `getUserMedia()` immediately when entering chat page.

Solution: Remove the automatic check and only request permission when user clicks the microphone button for the first time.

## Review
Completed successfully. The microphone permission is now requested only when the user first clicks the microphone button instead of immediately on chat page load.

Changes made:
1. Removed the automatic `checkMicrophonePermission()` call from the useEffect on component mount
2. Modified `handleRecording()` to check if permission is null (not yet requested) and request it on first click
3. Updated button disabled state to only disable when permission is explicitly denied (false), not when null
4. Updated "Grant mic access" button to only show when permission is explicitly denied

The fix maintains all existing functionality while improving the user experience by deferring permission requests until actually needed.

## Final Implementation Update
Additional fix applied to resolve permission flow issue:
1. Modified `checkMicrophonePermission()` to return the permission result
2. Updated `handleRecording()` to retry permission request even after denial (null or false states)
3. Removed permission state from button disabled condition to allow retry attempts
4. Updated system flow to handle immediate recording start on permission grant

The microphone permission now works seamlessly - users get the permission dialog when clicking the mic button, and recording starts immediately upon granting permission.
