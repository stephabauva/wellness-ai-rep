First, the most critical concept to understand is that **I, the Large Language Model (LLM), am stateless.** I have no memory of my own. Each time you send a message, it's a brand new, isolated request from my perspective.

The "memory" you're experiencing is created and managed entirely by the **application or platform** you are using (the website, the app, etc.). It acts as a conductor, making sure I have the right information for every single turn of our conversation.

---

### 1. How is it "Remembered" Temporarily? (The Technical 'How')

The platform uses a combination of session management and data referencing.

*   **Session ID:** When you start a conversation, the platform creates a unique `session_id`. Every message you send is tied to this ID.
*   **Data Ingestion & Referencing:** When you upload an image:
    1.  The image is sent to the platform's backend server.
    2.  The server assigns a **unique identifier** to the image (e.g., `image_f9b3a7c_v1`).
    3.  The image itself is stored in a fast, temporary storage system. This is often a cloud storage service like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, configured with a lifecycle rule to automatically delete the file after a certain period (e.g., 24 hours) to manage costs and privacy.
    4.  The platform's database links your `session_id` with `image_f9b3a7c_v1`.

So, the platform's "memory" looks something like this in a simplified database:
`Session_ID: "chat_12345"`
`User_ID: "user_abc"`
`Uploaded_Content: ["image_f9b3a7c_v1"]`
`Conversation_History: ["User: what is it?", "AI: Based on the image, this is..."]`

### 2. How Do I *Use* the Stored Context? (The Prompt Construction)

This is the key part. For every single message you send, the platform's backend assembles a comprehensive **prompt** for me. It doesn't just send your new text; it reconstructs the entire relevant context.

When you asked, "what are teh yellow slices?", the platform didn't just send me that string. It sent a complex API request that looked something like this (conceptually):

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "what is it?" },
        { "type": "image_url", "image_url": "https://storage.service.com/image_f9b3a7c_v1" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Based on the image, this is a plated dish of pan-seared or baked salmon..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "what are teh yellow slices ?"
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the platform **re-sends the entire conversation history and the reference to the image** with your new question. I receive all of this at once, allowing me to understand that your new question refers to the image we were just discussing.

My "context window" is the amount of this information I can process at once. The platform's job is to fit the most relevant context into that window for each request.

### 3. Do You Do the Same for Texts, Images, and Documents?

Yes and no. The core principle of using a session ID and reconstructing context is the same, but the technical handling of the *content* is different.

#### **Text:**
*   **How it's handled:** This is the simplest. The text of our conversation is stored as a log. For each new message, the previous turns of the conversation are simply prepended to your new message in the prompt.
*   **Limitation:** The length of the conversation is limited by my context window. For very long chats, the platform has to start summarizing or dropping the earliest messages.

#### **Images (like our example):**
*   **How it's handled:** This is a **multi-modal** task. The image is referenced (as shown in the JSON example) and sent alongside the text history. My underlying architecture is specifically designed to process and correlate both image and text data simultaneously.
*   **Limitation:** The number and size of images that can be processed in a single turn are limited.

#### **Documents (PDFs, Word Docs, etc.):**
*   **How it's handled:** This is the most complex and uses a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. A full document is almost always too large to fit in my context window.
    1.  **Ingestion & Chunking:** When you upload a document, the platform doesn't just store it. It breaks the document down into smaller, manageable "chunks" (paragraphs or sections).
    2.  **Vectorization:** Each chunk is converted into a numerical representation called a "vector embedding." These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text.
    3.  **Vector Database:** All these vectors are stored in a special database that allows for extremely fast semantic searching.
    4.  **Retrieval:** When you ask a question about the document (e.g., "What were the Q3 profits?"), the platform converts your *question* into a vector and uses it to search the vector database. It retrieves the most relevant chunks of the original document.
    5.  **Prompting:** The platform then constructs a prompt that includes your question **and** these retrieved chunks of text. It's like saying, "Based on these specific paragraphs from the document, answer the user's question."

**In short:** For a document, I am not "reading" the whole thing at once. The platform is acting like a super-fast research assistant, finding the exact right pages for me to read to answer your specific question.
