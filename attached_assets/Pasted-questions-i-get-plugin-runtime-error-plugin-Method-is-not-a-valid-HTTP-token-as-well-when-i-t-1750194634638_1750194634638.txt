questions : i get '[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Method is not a valid HTTP token.' as well when i tried to 'Export my data' or 'view access log', is it normal ? is it going to be implementedt in a later phase ? (dont write code files)

also for the dashboard metrics visibility, thought this could be done directly in the health dashboard section, where a card opens, all metrics appears under their category, they each have a '+' symbol on their left, when you click it it gets added to the health dashboard, the user can also input some text in a search bar, to search through the list of metrics direclty. The list must include all metrics found in smartphones' health app such as 'Steps, Distance Walked/Run, Flights Climbed, Active Energy/Calories, Resting Energy, Exercise Minutes, Stand Hours, Workouts, Heart Rate, Resting Heart Rate, Walking Heart Rate Average, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), High and Low Heart Rate Notifications, Irregular Rhythm Notifications, ECG (Electrocardiogram), AFib History, Blood Oxygen (SpO2), Respiratory Rate, Sleep Duration, Sleep Stages (Awake, Light, Deep, REM), Time in Bed, Sleep Consistency, Wrist Temperature, Menstrual Cycle Tracking, Ovulation Estimates, Mindful Minutes, State of Mind/Mood Logging, Stress Level, Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Cardio Fitness (VO2 Max), Heart Rate Recovery, Readiness Score/Body Battery, Walking Steadiness, Walking Speed, Step Length, Walking Asymmetry, Double Support Time (Gait), Running Power, Ground Contact Time, Vertical Oscillation, Fall Detection, Crash Detection, Environmental Sound Levels, Headphone Audio Levels, Time in Daylight, UV Index, Handwashing Detection, Blood Pressure (via connected cuffs), Blood Glucose (via connected CGMs), Hydration/Water Intake, Caffeine Intake, Medications Logged, Symptoms Logged, Body Weight, Body Fat Percentage, Body Mass Index (BMI), Lean Body Mass, and downloaded Health Records (e.g., allergies, immunizations, lab results)', edit the plan changelog/7-user-controlled-health-data/phase-1-implementation-issues-and-fixes.md to get that instead of in the settings.
