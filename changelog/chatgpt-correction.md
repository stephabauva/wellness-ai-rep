Yes — that assessment and the changes suggested by your AI agent are mostly correct and very insightful, with some important clarifications.

✅ What’s Correct in Their Explanation

✅ 1. ChatGPT includes actual image data in the API call
  •	OpenAI’s Vision API, when used via the Chat API, expects messages that contain multi-part content, such as:

{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "What are the yellow slices?" },
    { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "data:image/png;base64,..." } }
  ]
}


  •	So yes, base64 image data must be included at the point of each request if you want the model to “see” the image again.

✅ 2. ChatGPT doesn’t rely solely on pre-processed descriptions
  •	Unlike simplified apps that just store a caption or tags, ChatGPT passes the raw image data with every API call when an image is referenced again.
  •	That allows it to re-interpret images in multiple ways based on new questions, not just re-use a static description.

✅ 3. Proper formatting matters
  •	The [{type: "text"}, {type: "image_url"}] format is required for GPT-4o and GPT-4 with vision in the OpenAI API.
  •	This is crucial — many apps fail because they embed image descriptions instead of image objects.

❌ What Needs Clarification or Improvement

⚠️ 1. ChatGPT does not actually persist base64 images between API calls
  •	OpenAI’s backend doesn’t “remember” the raw image — you (the developer) must resend the image every time it’s needed in context.
  •	So persistence must be managed on your side — storing the image (e.g. in S3 or locally), then re-including the image_url or base64 in every relevant message.

In ChatGPT the app UI automates that. For each follow-up question, the image you uploaded is quietly reattached to the new message in the background.

✅ So yes, your AI agent is right to change the logic from:
  •	“Store image once, extract text, discard image”
to
  •	“Keep image in every relevant user message, so the AI has access to the actual pixels”

🧠 Summary of What You Should Do

Task	Implementation
✅ Keep original images	Store base64 or URL in your backend (file system, S3, etc.)
✅ Modify user messages	Always send [{type: "text"}, {type: "image_url"}] messages for image-based questions
✅ Drop text-only captions as “ground truth”	Let the vision model re-analyze as needed
✅ Simplify prompt engineering	Let the vision model “see” instead of relying on long descriptions
✅ Manage image context explicitly	Your app is in charge of persisting the image between turns

✅ Bonus Tip: How ChatGPT Web UI Works Behind the Scenes

When you upload an image:
  1.	It’s uploaded to OpenAI’s CDN or internal store.
  2.	Every follow-up question automatically includes that image in the message payload.
  3.	You can verify this by inspecting the web request to OpenAI — you’ll see the image URL sent again.
