# ChatSection Refactoring - January 14, 2025

## Overview
Major refactoring of the ChatSection component to improve maintainability, readability, and code organization without affecting functionality.

## Changes Made

### Code Organization
- **Reduced main component from 500+ to ~280 lines**
- **Extracted 4 custom hooks** for better separation of concerns
- **Created utility functions** for common operations
- **Maintained 100% functionality** - no breaking changes

### New Files Created

#### Custom Hooks
1. **`useFileManagement.ts`** - Handles file uploads, attachments, and file operations
2. **`useChatMessages.ts`** - Manages message sending, conversation state, and API interactions
3. **`useReportGeneration.ts`** - Handles PDF report generation functionality

#### Utilities
4. **`chatUtils.ts`** - Contains utility functions like `getFileIcon` and message display logic

### Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual features
- **Better Testing**: Each hook can be tested in isolation
- **Enhanced Readability**: Main component focuses on UI rendering
- **Reusability**: Hooks can be reused in other components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has a clear, focused purpose
