1. when using speech-to-text usign OpenAI, while saying "this is a test", it comes back as "thank you"

2. when using speech-to-text using Goole, the API seems blocked, need to check permissions.

3. When using the microphone with Web Speech API, the microphone stops recording after a small pause in the speech, increase the duration.

4. [fixed] When using the microphone with Web Speech API, when clicking back on the rotating ring, it says "speech recognition error: aborted", it should just stop the recording. 

5. [fixed] When using the microphone, instead of a rotating ring, i would prefer to keep the mic symbol, blinking red.

6. (Not really an issue) The data in Health Dashboard comes from a storage file, not from the database, although things are in place to use the database

7. What you write or add in the chat disappear if you go out in another tab and come back, it should persist, and it should have a button to clear the text input if needed

8. i took pictures using both OpenAI and Google and they "cant process images"
