Added - Comprehensive Health Data System

Database Schema Expansion

Enhanced Health Data Structure: Added category and metadata fields to health data schema
Health Data Categories: Implemented 5 primary categories:
Body Composition (weight, BMI, body fat %, muscle mass, BMR, etc.)
Cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, oxygen saturation)
Lifestyle (sleep, activity, nutrition, hydration, stress, mood)
Medical (blood glucose, HbA1c, lab results, medications)
Advanced (VO2 max, lactate threshold, performance metrics)
Health Metrics Coverage

Body Composition: Weight, BMI, body fat percentage, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, body water percentage, muscle mass, bone mass, basal metabolic rate, metabolic age
Cardiovascular Health: Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), heart rate, resting heart rate, HRV, cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, triglycerides, total), oxygen saturation
Lifestyle Metrics: Sleep duration/quality/phases, daily steps, exercise tracking, calorie burn/intake, hydration, stress levels, mood tracking
Medical Indicators: Blood glucose (fasting, postprandial, random), HbA1c, insulin dosage, ketone levels, body temperature, medication adherence
