If you‚Äôre aiming to replicate ChatGPT‚Äôs memory system exactly, here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown based on what‚Äôs publicly known from OpenAI, reverse engineering behaviors in ChatGPT, and best practices in production LLM infrastructure. While OpenAI doesn‚Äôt publish all the low-level implementation details, we can reconstruct a very close replica of how ChatGPT‚Äôs memory flow likely works ‚Äî both architecturally and technically.

üß† ChatGPT-like Memory System ‚Äì Full Architecture & Technical Workflow

üîß Stack Assumptions (Based on OpenAI + Industry Practices)

Layer	| Likely Stack
Backend	| Python (FastAPI + asyncio)
LLM APIs	| OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, or internal models
Embeddings	| text-embedding-3-small (via OpenAI API)
Vector Store	| FAISS, Pinecone, or pgvector in PostgreSQL
Database	| PostgreSQL
Real-time queueing	| Redis Streams, Celery, or Kafka
Frontend	| TypeScript + React
Streaming	| Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets

üìà HIGH-LEVEL FLOW: ‚ÄúExactly like ChatGPT‚Äù

Step 1: User Sends Message
  ‚Ä¢	Frontend sends message to backend.
  ‚Ä¢	Backend immediately:
  ‚Ä¢	Sends message to LLM for reply (via /v1/chat/completions)
  ‚Ä¢	Optionally logs message with metadata

‚∏ª

Step 2: LLM Reply Begins Streaming
  ‚Ä¢	LLM generates and streams response via SSE
  ‚Ä¢	Meanwhile (in parallel or soon after), the message is analyzed for memory

‚∏ª

Step 3: Memory Detection Pipeline (Separate GPT call)

A separate GPT-4-turbo call is made (with system prompt like):
```json
System prompt: "Extract any user facts, preferences, instructions, or identity-related information that may be useful to remember. Output in structured JSON."
User: "My dog is named Luna and I'm moving to Barcelona next month."
```

üì• Output:
```json
[
  { "type": "pet", "key": "dog", "value": "Luna" },
  { "type": "location_future", "key": "moving_to", "value": "Barcelona", "timestamp": "2025-06-13" }
]
```

Step 4: Deduplication Check (Semantic)

Each candidate memory goes through semantic deduplication:
  ‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Embedding generation using text-embedding-3-small
  ‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Vector similarity check (cosine sim > 0.85)
  ‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If already stored ‚Üí skip or update
  ‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If new or update-worthy ‚Üí insert

Usually via something like:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

new_vector = get_embedding("User's dog is named Luna")
existing_vectors = load_existing_memory_embeddings()

for existing in existing_vectors:
    if cosine_similarity([new_vector], [existing.vector])[0][0] > 0.85:
        # Skip or update
        return
```

‚∏ª

Step 5: Memory Storage

Structured memory is stored in a table like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE memory (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  key TEXT,
  value TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  embedding VECTOR(1536),
  importance_score FLOAT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_seen_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Memory entries are:
  ‚Ä¢	Queried with semantic similarity (for context injection)
  ‚Ä¢	Possibly categorized (preferences, location, instructions, identity)
  ‚Ä¢	Often include source message reference

‚∏ª

Step 6: Future Messages Use Memory (Retrieval)

When the user sends future messages:
  ‚Ä¢	Retrieve top N memories via semantic search
  ‚Ä¢	Inject them into system prompt context, like:

You are talking to a user who has a dog named Luna and is moving to Barcelona.


‚∏ª

üîÑ How does ChatGPT handle fast multiple messages?

ChatGPT uses:
  ‚Ä¢	Queueing (Redis, Kafka, or internal) to track and debounce memory updates.
  ‚Ä¢	Timestamps and overwrite logic: If user says ‚ÄúI live in Paris‚Äù then ‚ÄúI moved to Berlin‚Äù, the location memory is updated with newer data.
  ‚Ä¢	Memory worker process: A separate async worker ingests messages, runs GPT extraction, deduplication, and storage without blocking the chat flow.

Layer	 | Tool
Frontend	| React + TypeScript + SSE
Backend	| Python + FastAPI + asyncio
Memory Detection	| GPT-4-turbo API call with JSON output
Deduplication	| OpenAI Embeddings + cosine similarity
Storage	| PostgreSQL + pgvector
Queueing (optional)	| Redis Streams or Celery
Streaming	| SSE with chunked responses


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì What ChatGPT Likely Does
  ‚Ä¢	Memory detection happens after every message, in parallel to chat.
  ‚Ä¢	Uses a dedicated GPT call to extract structured memory facts.
  ‚Ä¢	Deduplication via embedding similarity.
  ‚Ä¢	Stores structured memory with embeddings, timestamps, and types.
  ‚Ä¢	Uses memory in system prompt context for future LLM calls.
  ‚Ä¢	All async and real-time with non-blocking architecture.
