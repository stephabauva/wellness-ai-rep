1. when using speech-to-text usign OpenAI, while saying "this is a test", it comes back as "thank you"

2. when using speech-to-text using Goole, the API seems blocked, need to check permissions.
(see perplexity history: google transcription error)

3. When using the microphone with Web Speech API, the microphone stops recording after a small pause in the speech, increase the duration.

4. [fixed] When using the microphone with Web Speech API, when clicking back on the rotating ring, it says "speech recognition error: aborted", it should just stop the recording. 

5. [fixed] When using the microphone, instead of a rotating ring, i would prefer to keep the mic symbol, blinking red.
